- PyCaret is an open-source, **low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows**. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.
- Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, `spaCy`, `Optuna` and a few more.
- The design and simplicity of PyCaret are inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more technical expertise.
